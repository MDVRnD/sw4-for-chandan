    Can you run MZZ, MXX, MYY seismograms for a layered medium in your SW4 and send  me the out output with the model? Kindly do it.

# Introduction

We obtained [SW4](https://computing.llnl.gov/projects/serpentine-wave-propagation) 
[v3.0](https://github.com/geodynamics/sw4/releases/tag/v3.0)
from [GitHub](https://github.com/geodynamics/sw4) 
and compiled on macos with [MPICH](https://www.mpich.org) 
using the following `make.inc` file:
```
proj = yes
SW4ROOT = /opt/homebrew
fftw = yes
# homebrew version uses openmpi so installed our own for mpich
FFTWHOME = /Users/ford17/Applications/fftw-3.3.10
FC = mpif90
CXX = mpicxx
EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS = -framework Accelerate -L/opt/homebrew/lib/gcc/current -lgfortran
```


# Verification

We reproduce the results from the [excellent tutorial](https://rbherrmann.github.io/ComputerProgramsSeismology/TUTORIAL/SW4CPS/index.html) 
by [Bob Herrmann](https://www.slu.edu/science-and-engineering/academics/earth-atmospheric-sciences/faculty/herrmann-robert.php)
who compared SW4 with [CPS](https://rbherrmann.github.io/ComputerProgramsSeismology/index.html)
and found "excellent agreement".

Bob used a triangular pulse source-time function and convolved the recordings with a triangle of 1 s duration.


# Method

The requirements are:

- Station at (x,y,z) = (60, 0, 0)
- Source at (x,y,z) = (10, 0, 10)
- WUS model
- PPW for 5 Hz
- Dirac source

So we use the following SW4 input `run.sw4in` file:
```
fileio pfs=1 nwriters=16 path=mxx.dir printcycle=1000
grid x=70e3 y=35e3 z=50e3 h=100
time t=60
refinement zmax=35000
block vp=7900.0 vs=4620.0 rho=3276.0 qp=60976 qs=27027
block vp=6352.0 vs=3756.5 rho=2805.6 qp=658 qs=293 z2=35000
block vp=5544.5 vs=3295.3 rho=2608.9 qp=287 qs=128 z2=8000
block vp=3406.5 vs=2008.9 rho=2215.0 qp=331 qs=147 z2=1900
source x=10e3 y=0 z=10e3 mxx=1e18 type=Dirac
rec x=60e3 y=0 z=0 file=rec sacformat=1
image mode=s y=0 cycle=1
```

Note that refinement was used for a more efficient calculation.

And to calculate the results we could use the command:
```
mpirun -np 16 sw4 mxx.sw4in
```

In practice we used many more processors available on ruby from [LC](https://hpc.llnl.gov) 
with the slurm script:
```
#SBATCH -N 36
#SBATCH -J run
#SBATCH -t 360
#SBATCH -p pbatch
#SBATCH --license=lustre1
#SBATCH -A gmp
#SBATCH -o run.sw4out
#SBATCH -e run.sw4err

# Max: 1440 minutes (24 hours) on 520 nodes

# Set CPUS/nodes for RUBY (limit 520 nodes for 24 hours)
@ CPUSPERNODE = 56
# Compute number of CPUs
@ NCPUS = ( $SLURM_JOB_NUM_NODES * $CPUSPERNODE )

srun -n$NCPUS /usr/workspace/ford17/sw4/optimize_ruby_mp/sw4 mxx.sw4in
srun -n$NCPUS /usr/workspace/ford17/sw4/optimize_ruby_mp/sw4 myy.sw4in
srun -n$NCPUS /usr/workspace/ford17/sw4/optimize_ruby_mp/sw4 mzz.sw4in
```


# Results

Our goal for an accurate calculation is to have a minimum points per wavelength (PPW) of between 6 and 10.
The PPW is related to the smallest wave velocity $v$ [m/s] divided by the grid spacing $h$ [m]divided by the maximum frequency represented $f$ [1/s]. and For the two grids (one grid with one refinement) the points per wavelength (PPW) for a 5 Hz maximum frequency is:

$$
\text{PPW} = v / h / f = 2008.9 / 50 / 5 \approxeq 8 
$$

Calculated displacements low passed at 5 Hz are shown in @fig-results.

```{python}
#| label: fig-results
#| fig-cap: "Calculated displacements low passed at 5 Hz plotted with [ObsPy](https://www.obspy.org)."

# import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
# import pandas as pd
from obspy import read

stream = read("Run/mxx.dir/rec.?", format="SAC")
stream.filter('lowpass', freq=5.0)
stream.plot();
```

The shear wave velocity model is shown in @fig-model.

```{python}
#| label: fig-model
#| fig-cap: "Shear wave velocity model plotted with [VisIt](https://visit.llnl.gov/)"

from os import system

# system write a file called fig-model.py

# system("visit -cli -nowin -s fig-model.py");

```
